**Multi-Dimensional Vector in Python**

**Multi-Dimensional Vector**:
- A multi-dimensional vector is a mathematical object that extends the concept of vectors to n-dimensions.
- A 2D vector has two components (x, y).
- A 3D vector has three components (x, y, z).
In general, an n-dimensional vector has n components, making it useful in mathematics, computer graphics, data science, and physics.

**Description**:
A simple **multi-dimensional vector class** implemented in Python, demonstrating **object-oriented programming** and **operator overloading**.

**Features**:
This project is a beginner-friendly Python implementation of a Vector class that supports operations on n-dimensional vectors, such as:
- Create vectors of any dimension (e.g., 2D, 3D, etc.)
- Indexing and updating vector elements
- Access and modify elements using indexing
- Add vectors together (`Vector + Vector`)
- Add vector with list (`Vector + [list]`)
- Checking equality (`==`, `!=`)
- Clean String representation (`<1, 2, 3>`)
